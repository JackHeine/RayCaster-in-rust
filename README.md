# RayCaster-in-rust
A very privative 3D renderer 

This program was made with the instructions from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA. 

I did this So I could learn about rust, macroquad, and 3D rendering. I plan on working on this more in the future.

There is no collision, and the 2D map can be toggled by holding down TAB.
